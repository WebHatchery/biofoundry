# Biofoundry — Game Design

*This document describes the game **as implemented** — every phase of the
original plan (0–5) and of the automation plan (6–11) has shipped. All numbers
quoted here come from `assets/data/*.json`; that's the source of truth, and
it's tunable without recompiling. Work still outstanding lives in
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md).*

## 1. Genre & positioning

Biofoundry started from a factory-builder pitch, but what emerged is a
**colony simulation with an automation backbone** — closer to RimWorld or
Dwarf Fortress than to Factorio, and deliberately so.

What it takes from each tradition:

| From factory builders (Factorio) | From colony sims (RimWorld / DF) |
| --- | --- |
| A production/consumption ledger you optimize (the food grid HUD is a power graph) | Indirect control: you designate, assign, and place — creatures decide how |
| Production chains (ore → ingots via the blacksmith, or wood → charcoal → smelter) | Workers with needs, hunger states, and desertion |
| Buildings as throughput nodes with input/output rates | Emergent crises: famine spirals, raids on the larder |
| Explicit "factory complete" style goals | A living map: wild creatures wander in, capture/study progression |

There are **no belts, no inserters, no direct unit orders, and no blueprints**.
Logistics is creatures walking: a "conveyor" is a goblin carrier (or a beetle)
physically hauling one load at a time along BFS paths. The optimization game is
real — where you place farms relative to the cook pot changes throughput — but
you optimize by shaping a habitat and a workforce, not by routing machinery.

The honest one-liner: **a simulation game about running an economy of hungry
creatures, played with factory-game instincts.** RimWorld colonies become
automation engines by the late game; Biofoundry starts from that end state and
makes the automation itself alive.

## 2. Design pillars (as shipped)

1. **Living automation.** Every unit of throughput is a creature with a
   position, a path, a stomach, and a job. Nothing teleports; nothing is
   abstract. If the cook is hungry, stew production physically slows.
2. **Food is the power grid.** There is no electricity. Every creature has an
   upkeep draw in food/min; farms are generators, cook pots are power plants,
   the stockpile is the battery, famine is a brownout, starvation is a
   blackout. The HUD surfaces this exactly like a power UI.
3. **Progression is biological.** No research tree. Unlocks fire from event
   counters on things the player already does: capture creatures, survive
   crises, forge ingots.
4. **Ecosystem pressure.** The world pushes back — wild beetles wander in,
   gnarl raiders eat your larder, and your own hungry guards can desert at the
   worst moment. Failure is ecological, and always telegraphed by the meter.

## 3. Player verbs (the control model)

The player never orders a specific creature to a specific tile. The full verb
set:

- **Assign jobs** — a Jobs panel with −/+ counters per job (Miner, Carrier,
  Cook, Smith, Guard); goblins move between jobs and the idle pool. This is the
  primary crisis-response lever: shifting miners into carriers before the
  famine is the game's first learned skill.
- **Designate digs** — Dig mode toggles designations on rock; miners carve the
  tunnels (uncovering the ore veins inside) on their own time. Digging is the
  *expansion* verb — it exposes veins; **Mines** exploit them.
- **Place buildings** — Build mode drops a ghost; carriers haul banked ore to
  the site; it becomes real when supplied. Placement is the layout game:
  farms near the cook pot mean shorter hauls and faster stew. The **Mine** is
  the first *workstation* — it may only be placed on floor beside an ore vein.
- **Attract specialists** — spend banked ore to attract a Beetle Hauler
  (25 ore) or a Salamander Smelter (20 ore); breed Hobgoblins and an Overseer
  at the Breeding Pit (spend ingots, once forged-ingot unlocks fire).
- **Queue equipment** — the Blacksmith's inspection panel holds a production
  queue; order a pickaxe/frame/hammer/blade and the Smith crafts it from
  banked ingots. The one explicit production verb — everything else is
  placement and job counts.
- **Inspect** — click a building for status (a Mine's miners / ore-per-minute
  with pickaxes folded in / buffer / deposit; a Blacksmith's ore/ingots/queue).
- **Save/load** — F5/F9, full-simulation snapshot.

Everything else — pathing, hauling priorities, eating, fighting, fleeing — is
the simulation's job.

## 4. The food grid

The central mechanic. Every creature drains satiation continuously and refills
from the stockpile; the stockpile is fed by the farm → haul → cook chain.

- **Upkeep**: a working goblin draws 2 food/min. Cooks and guards work harder:
  ×2 (4/min). Idle creatures draw ×0.5. A beetle draws 5/min — the classic
  "is one expensive specialist worth ten cheap generalists?" decision.
- **Generation**: a Mushroom Farm grows 14 mushrooms/min (local cap 24;
  carriers must haul them or the farm idles). A Cook Pot converts 2 mushrooms
  → 3 food per 6-second batch — cooking multiplies calories, so the kitchen is
  the power plant, not the farm.
- **Battery & meter**: the HUD's calorie ledger shows production/min,
  upkeep/min, stockpile, and **time-to-empty** — the Factorio power graph,
  reskinned. The same panel doubles as a **factory dashboard**: ore-to-
  stockpile/min, ingots-forged/min, and pending-haul pressure (so "add a
  carrier" is a read, not a guess).
- **Brownout**: when the stockpile empties, creatures don't die — work speed
  degrades as they starve. Hungry carriers slow the kitchen, which deepens the
  famine: a legible cascade.
- **Blackout**: a creature starving for 90 continuous seconds deserts the
  warren. Guards deserting during a famine is how raids become lethal — the
  death spiral is intentional and visible on the meter.
- **Load-shedding**: carriers triage. Below a 40-food reserve they serve the
  kitchen first; above it, industry (wood, charcoal, construction). The player
  feels this as the factory "dimming" during food stress.
- **Recovery**: refeeding fully restores work speed; surviving a famine
  (recovering to 20+ food) increments the `famines_survived` counter and
  unlocks Preservation Techniques.

On the default seed the first famine hits **~4 sim-minutes in** and is
survivable by reassigning workers — this is the tuned first crisis, taught by
the tutorial.

## 5. Creatures

All species live in `assets/data/species.json`.

| Species | Diet | Upkeep | Carry | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goblin | food | 2/min (×2 cook/guard/smith, ×0.5 idle) | 1 | The generalist. Reassignable between Miner / Carrier / Cook / Smith / Guard / Idle. |
| Hobgoblin | food | 5/min | 1 | Heavyweight worker: **×2 work speed** at any job for ×2.5 upkeep — the specialist-vs-generalist ledger, now for labour itself. Bred at the Breeding Pit (unlock: forge 30 ingots). |
| Goblin Overseer | food | 6/min | 0 | The living beacon: doesn't work, but **×1.35 work speed** to every worker in its aura. One per district. Bred at the Breeding Pit (unlock: forge 45 ingots). |
| Beetle Hauler | food | 5/min | 5 | Dedicated hauler, 5× a goblin's load. Attracted for 25 ore; not reassignable. |
| Salamander Smelter | **charcoal** | — | 0 | A living furnace: its meal is its fuel. Attracted for 20 ore; works the Smelter Den. |
| Wild Beetle | — | — | — | Wanders in from the map edge (every ~100 s, max 2 loose). Capturable in snare traps. |
| Gnarl Raider | your stockpile | — | — | Raid antagonist: beelines for the larder and eats 30 food/min until driven off or sated (flees after 12). |

Jobs (goblins only): **Miner** (claims a slot at a Mine and extracts ore into
its buffer; also carves dig designations to expand the warren), **Carrier**
(hauls mushrooms, mine ore, ingots, wood, charcoal, and building materials),
**Cook** (runs the pot), **Smith** (claims a Blacksmith and hammers ore into
ingots; eats cook-tier), **Guard** (8 DPS,
patrols the stockpile, intercepts raiders; fed creatures regenerate HP —
starving guards lose fights), **Idle** (reserve pool, half upkeep).

## 6. Buildings & production chains

Buildings cost banked ore, are placed as ghosts, and are built when carriers
deliver materials. From `assets/data/buildings.json`:

| Building | Ore | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mushroom Farm | 10 | Grows mushrooms (food chain input). |
| Ore Mine | 12 | *Workstation.* Placed beside an ore vein; a stationed miner extracts ore into a local buffer that carriers drain to the stockpile. Finite (but generous) deposit. |
| Cook Pot | 8 | Mushrooms → stew (the calorie multiplier). |
| Blacksmith | 8 | *Workstation.* A goblin Smith hammers ore → ingots (2 ore → 1 ingot). No charcoal, no unlock — the first processing node, live from the early minutes. Deliberately ore-inefficient so the smelter stays the bulk upgrade. |
| Charcoal Kiln | 12 | Sporewood → charcoal, 3/min (wood cap 8). |
| Smelter Den | 15 | Salamander workstation: 1 ore + 1 charcoal → 1 ingot per 10 s batch — the bulk (ore-efficient) forge. |
| Snare Trap | 6 | Single-use wild-beetle capture. |
| Study Pen | 12 | Captured specimens generate knowledge (1/min each) and drive unlock counters. |
| Breeding Pit | 20 | *Unlocked by studying beetles.* Hatches free beetle haulers every 150 s (cap 3). |
| Worm Shrine | 20 | *Unlocked by forging 20 ingots.* The campaign monument (see §8). |
| Stockpile | — | The battery/larder (starts on the map; raid target). |

The three chains, each of which **eats**:

1. **Food (the grid):** farm grows mushrooms → carriers haul → cook pot makes
   stew → stockpile → every stomach in the warren.
2. **Ore (construction & goals):** a stationed miner works the **Mine** (a
   placed workstation beside a vein), extracting ore into the mine's local
   buffer → carriers drain the buffer to the stockpile → banked ore pays for
   buildings and attracting specialists. Extraction runs itself: place a mine,
   a goblin claims a slot, ore flows — the first live automation loop. Digging
   stays the expansion verb that opens fresh veins to mine.
3. **Ingots (the forge chains):** two forges make ingots, banked at the
   stockpile and counted toward the factory goal.
   - *Blacksmith (early):* a goblin Smith hammers banked ore into ingots
     (2 ore → 1 ingot) — no fuel, live from the early minutes. Ore-hungry by design.
   - *Smelter Den (bulk upgrade):* sporewood groves (regrow ~45 s) → carriers
     haul wood → kiln smoulders charcoal → salamander eats the charcoal *as
     its smelting fuel* → 1 ore + 1 charcoal → 1 ingot. Industry depends on
     forestry depends on hauling depends on food — the mid-game complexity
     curve in one chain. Smelters draw banked ore only above a 12-ore reserve
     (with an emergency trickle) so endless smelting can't starve construction;
     an idle salamander nibbles the den's charcoal so an ore drought can't
     starve the furnace.

## 6b. Equipment: the feedback loop

Ingots don't just satisfy a goal — they feed back into throughput. From
`assets/data/equipment.json`, the Blacksmith crafts gear from banked ingots:

| Item | Cost | Job | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Iron Pickaxe | 2 ingots | Miner | Mine extraction ×1.5 |
| Hauling Frame | 2 ingots | Carrier | Carry capacity +1 |
| Smith's Hammer | 3 ingots | Smith | Blacksmith work time ×0.75 |
| Guard Blade | 3 ingots | Guard | Guard DPS ×1.5 (stacks with Hardened Guards) |

The loop closes: **a goblin works the Mine → a carrier hauls ore to the
Blacksmith → the Smith forges ingots → ingots become a pickaxe → the Mine
speeds up.** Extraction → logistics → processing → *back into extraction*,
built entirely out of creatures — the biological answer to Factorio modules.

Control stays indirect. The player **queues** a craft on the Blacksmith's
panel (the one explicit production verb); the Smith works the queue when it
has the ingots. Finished gear waits at the stockpile, and creatures pick up
whatever matches their job on their own — no per-creature micromanagement. A
reassigned goblin drops job-mismatched gear back to the pool. No durability:
gear is a permanent upgrade, and an upgraded workforce is *visible* (a glint
on every equipped worker).

Gear is one of **two multiplying upgrade axes**. The other is breeding (§5):
a Hobgoblin miner (×2) wearing an Iron Pickaxe (×1.5), standing in a Goblin
Overseer's aura (×1.35), mines at ~4× a bare goblin — so a mature warren runs
on *fewer, better* creatures than a mid-game crowd at the same throughput.

## 7. Progression: capture → study → adapt

No tech tree. `assets/data/unlocks.json` defines event-counter unlocks —
progression is a side effect of playing, and crises double as gates:

| Counter | Threshold | Unlock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beetles captured | 2 | **Beetle Breeding Pit** (free hauler production) |
| Raids survived | 1 | **Hardened Guards** (guard DPS ×1.5) |
| Famines survived | 1 | **Preservation Techniques** (farm storage ×1.5) |
| Ingots forged | 20 | **Worm Shrine** (the endgame) |
| Ingots forged | 30 | **Hobgoblin Brood** (breed heavyweight workers) |
| Ingots forged | 45 | **Goblin Overseer** (breed the work-speed beacon) |

The capture loop: wild beetles wander the map → place snare traps in their
path → captured specimens go to Study Pens → knowledge accumulates → counters
tick → unlocks fire with a toast.

## 8. Threats & the campaign arc

**Threats.** Famine (from ~5.5 min, recurring whenever the ledger goes
negative) and **gnarl raids**: first at 9 minutes, then every ~6.3 minutes,
up to 3 raiders who eat the stockpile directly. Guards fight them off; the
raid *is* a food-grid event (raiders are hungry too), and the famine ↔
desertion ↔ raid loss spiral is the game's failure state.

**The arc**, on the fixed default seed (full-campaign probe test):

| Beat | ~Sim time | What it asks of the player |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First famine | ~4 min | Read the meter, reassign jobs. |
| **Warren Secured** (win 1) | ~18 min | Hold a 100-food surplus + deliver 50 ore. |
| **Factory Complete** (win 2) | ~25 min | Place a Blacksmith (the salamander smelter is the bulk alternative), forge 20 ingots. |
| **Worm Awakened** (campaign) | ~37 min | Build the Worm Shrine; feed the Colossal Worm 110 food of offerings. |

The Worm Shrine is the endgame stress test: the worm demands offerings at
**8 food/min** — a permanent heavy draw on the grid — but pauses politely
below a 25-food reserve, so it pressures the economy without being able to
blackout the warren by itself. Sating it awakens the worm, which coils around
its shrine as a monument; **endless mode** continues after, with ongoing raid
pressure. The campaign is one sitting (~49 minutes), losing at most a worker
or two if played reactively.

## 9. Onboarding

A seven-step tutorial (`assets/data/tutorial.json`) shows as a HUD card in new
warrens. Every step advances on a **real player action**, not a timer or a
"next" button: look around → place a Farm → meet the Mine (it's already
working) → place the Blacksmith → weather the famine → craft an Iron Pickaxe
(and feel the Mine speed up) → win. The pickaxe step is the teaching
centrepiece — it closes the extraction → processing → extraction loop by hand.
Skippable; progress persists in saves.

## 10. World & presentation

- **Map**: 48×32 tiles, seeded deterministic generation (default seed
  `20260710`) — rock, dug tunnels, ore veins, mushroom patches (regrow 90 s),
  sporewood groves, water. Dig designations expand the warren
  Dwarf-Fortress-lite.
- **Camera**: toolkit pan/zoom (WASD / right-drag / scroll).
- **Status icons**: a colour-and-shape badge floats over any stalled
  workstation — no worker (yellow ring), starved (orange ▽), backed up
  (red ▲), awaiting haul (cyan crate), exhausted (grey ✕). A one-line legend
  appears while anything is stalled, so a broken chain link is diagnosable at
  a glance without clicking — the equivalent of Factorio's no-power icon.
- **Audio**: 7 synthesized SFX WAVs via toolkit `SoundManager` (build, eat,
  raid, victory, …), degrading to silence headless.
- **Title screen**: worm silhouette, mushroom clusters, drifting spores;
  captured as `catalog_thumbnail.png`.

## 11. Technical shape (summary)

Repo-standard architecture; see `README.md` and `docs/`:

- Fixed-timestep simulation decoupled from render; state-owned seeded RNG;
  stateless `simulation/` services (`food`, `jobs`, `nav`, `wildlife`), so
  integration tests run the sim headless for thousands of ticks — including
  a full-campaign probe on the fixed seed that guards the ~49-minute arc.
- **Everything balance-related is JSON** under `assets/data/` (`balance.json`,
  `species.json`, `buildings.json`, `unlocks.json`, `tutorial.json`,
  `game_config.json`) — edit the JSON, not Rust constants.
- UI is a pure view layer emitting `UiAction` intents; a dispatcher applies
  them. Headless capture scenes (`menu`, `warren`, `mine`, `blacksmith`,
  `equipment`, `overseer`, `factory`, `famine`, `raid`, `breeding`, …) verify
  the UI without interactive input.
- Full save/load of the live sim (F5/F9, toolkit persistence).

## 12. Backlog / future directions

The early-automation direction — staffed mines, the blacksmith and ingots,
equipment feedback loops, factory legibility, and the hobgoblin/overseer
breeding line — has shipped. What remains deferred from the original design,
in rough order of design interest, is tracked in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).
